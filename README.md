Game Description: Word Guessing Game
Objective:
The goal of the game is to guess a randomly selected word letter by letter before you run out of tries.

How to Play:

When the game starts, you’ll see a series of underscores (_) representing the letters of the hidden word.
You can guess one letter at a time by entering a single character.
If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position(s).
If the letter is not in the word, you lose one attempt.
Controls:

Difficulty Selection:
Before each game, you will be prompted to choose a difficulty level:

Easy: 10 tries.
Medium: 5 tries.
Hard: 3 tries.
Guessing Letters:

Enter one letter at a time. If your guess is correct, the letter will appear in the word; otherwise, you lose a try.
You cannot guess the same letter twice. If you try, the game will prompt you to enter a new letter.
The game shows a list of letters you’ve already guessed.
Game Continuation and Quit:

After each guess, press "Enter" to continue.
After the game ends (either by guessing the word or using up all attempts), you can choose to play again or quit:
Press 'q' or 'Q' to quit.
Press any other key to start a new game.
Winning the Game:
If you guess all the letters correctly before running out of attempts, you win! If you run out of tries before guessing the word, the game reveals the word and encourages you to try again.

Enjoy guessing, and good luck!
